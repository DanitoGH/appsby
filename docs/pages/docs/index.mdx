# Welcome to Appsby
Congratulations on learning about Appsby - you're just minutes way from launching your first full-stack web app, built right inside Gatsby. But before that, here's a recap on how we got here, and what we're solving.

## The problem
Gatsby solves lots of the tediousness of React by introducing code-splitting, bundling, optimizations, and pre-rendering.
However, to build a complete web application, there are still many variables you need to think about:
- You probably need a way to identify and authenticate users
- You probably need some server-side logic for CRUD operations on user-generated data
- You probably need a way for users to search multiple stores of data, so they can find what they need
- You may need to handle data uploaded by users in a robust way that supports authorization logic

Traditional frameworks include most of these features out-of-the-box, but can often be tedious to get working with Gatsby (or any React project for that matter). You want a solution that removes the tedious bits, like:
- Working with Fetch/XHR APIs
- Building search that works, and is easily interacted with via the front-end
- Building file upload validation, handling, and storing in the cloud
- Refreshing views when server-side data changes

If you're a Gatsby dev, you probably love the idea of Netlify/Vercel functions, but haven't ever been able to build anything non-gimmicky with them. You've probably tried to use something like AWS SAM or the Serverless Framework to get more functionality but then realized it's difficult to move quickly writing with Vanilla NodeJS. You might have even tried to launch a traditional NodeJS framework serverlessly, like Express, and found that it adds a lot of weight to your project without providing any of the serverless advantages (besides reduced operating cost).

## The solution: Appsby
### A full-stack serverless app framework right inside your Gatsby project

Appsby provides the power and extensibility of a dedicated Serverless NodeJS framework, with the ease of development/deployment that comes with Netlify/Vercel functions, all wrapped up in a React-style API.

It's been developed from the ground-up to provide the 'batteries-included' functionality of platforms like AWS Amplify and Google Firebase, but without all of the restrictions and reduced scalability.

It runs on AWS Infrastructure, uses FaunaDB for data storage, and integrates directly into your Gatsby front-end as a Gatsby plugin. It's a stack that's easy to develop for, virtually-infinitely scalable, super resilient, and 100% extendable (should you choose to do so). <b>More importantly though, it'll supercharge your productivity, and help you ship much better apps, much faster.</b> It's a framework that works as well for Indie Hackers as it does for Fortune 500 companies.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start a new Appsby project is to use the Gatsby starter. It generates a ready-to-use project with all needed dependencies.

### Create your new app:

```bash
npx gatsby-cli new app https://github.com/audal/appsby-starter
```

### Change directories into site folder

```bash
cd app
```

### Start development server

```bash
npm run develop
```

Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at http://localhost:8000.
