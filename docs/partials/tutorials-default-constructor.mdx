### ```constructor(connectionParameters)```
The constructor is something you'll probably be familiar with if you've used React or ES6+ JS features without Gatsby before. Class constructors instantiate a class with immediate values for use.

In the constructor we can set:
- ```this.getInitialState.documentType``` - this is the type of document we want. Again because the database is handled directly by Appsby, all we have to do to create a new document type is write it like this. Because we're doing authentication currently, our document type is going to be **user** (but we could also name it anything - there are no reserved document types in Appsby).
- ```this.getInitialState.documentId``` - this is the ID of the document we want to get. This is something that we probably won't have in authentication, as for most use cases you'll be logging in users by their email address, not their underlying ID. **IDs are generated by FaunaDB, so you can't use a user's email as the document's ID.** However, if you do want to use user numbers instead of email addresses, this is where you would set that (and potentially do it like ```this.getInitialState.documentId = connectionParameters.userId```).
- ```this.getInitialState.documentQualifiers``` - this is where you probably want to be for auth. This allows us to find a user by fields on their user document, instead of needing a document ID. So if your user documents have an ```email``` field, you can load the user's document by email with something like ```this.getInitialState.documentQualifiers = { email: connectionParameters.email }```. You can use multiple key/value pairs to search for multiple things in your documents, and Appsby will get the first exact match. Just make sure you don't let users sign up with non-unique emails!

You may also use the constructor to set other class-scoped variables that you might need later, or do anything else you'd usually do inside a constructor, however there's probably not many use cases for that. ```connectionParameters``` will be available after construction as a prop (let's get to that now).
